ðŸš— Number Plate Recognition and Speed Measurement 
A computer vision-based system designed to detect vehicle number plates and measure vehicle speed using real-time video feeds.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Vehicle Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.

Number Plate Extraction with OpenCV image processing techniques.

OCR Integration to read alphanumeric license plates from cropped images.

Speed Estimation by calculating frame-based displacement over time.

Real-time Processing with video feed inputs.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: YOLOv5, OpenCV, EasyOCR/Tesseract, TensorFlow

Applications: Traffic surveillance, law enforcement, and automated toll systems.

ðŸ“· Example Workflow
Capture video stream

Detect vehicle and license plate using YOLO

Process image using OpenCV
