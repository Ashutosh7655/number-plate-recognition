Number Plate Recognition using Deep Learning
License

Number Plate Recognition using Deep Learning is a project that aims to automatically detect and recognize license plates in images or video streams using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to train and deploy a number plate recognition system.

Features
License Plate Detection: The system can detect license plates in images using object detection algorithms.
Character Segmentation: Once a license plate is detected, the characters on the plate are segmented for recognition.
Character Recognition: The segmented characters are recognized using optical character recognition (OCR) models.
End-to-End Pipeline: This project offers an end-to-end pipeline for license plate detection and recognition.
Flexibility: The codebase can be extended and adapted for different license plate formats and regions.
